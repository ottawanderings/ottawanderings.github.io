        "For today's penultimate post, we present a potpurri of picks wich we hope will delight your doctoral daze.  For the student on the go, SB can't say enough good things about the deli sandwiches at [La Bottega](https://www.labottega.ca/pages/eat-in-take-out), an Italian grocery store that offers custom-made creations with a seriously solid selection of breads, cheeses, and toppings.  Foccacia with provolone, eggplant, and peppers, coming right up!  Speaking of students on the go, we thought we'd share a few more ideas for getting around town.  We're confident that you'll sort out OC Transpo (link) on your own, but for those days when you want a little more independence: - Drop into [re-Cycles](http://www.re-cycles.ca/) on Bronson, a community bike shop with an ever-changing offer of refurbished bicyles and plenty of spare parts to give old wheels new life.  - Swing by [The Cyclery](https://www.thecyclery.ca/) in Old Ottawa South anytime you need something shiny and new -- you'll pay a premium but they'll take care of you and your ride long after you roll out the door. - H&S are big fans of the freedom offered by car-sharing with [Communauto](https://ontario.communauto.com/), key to living a car-free life to the fullest.  Finally, DA reminds us that no student life in Ottawa is complete without good times at the [House of Targ](http://www.houseoftarg.com/) in Old Ottawa South, serving up a wonderfully bizarre combination of perogies and pinball that fills a primal need that you never knew you had.

        "Hope you're hungry, 'cause this last edition of Tuesday Foods-day is densely packed -- let's see what's going down in Centretown.\n\nDA starts things off in the heart of Ottawa at the [Tavern on the Hill](https://www.tavernonthehillottawa.com/) hidden away in Major's Hill Park.  The Tavern was voted Ottawa's top patio for one simple reason: stunning views of the river and Parliament Hill.  Toss in their second kiosk at the Rideau Falls with live jazz at both locations and we're sure you'll find a few summer delights.\n\nAlso they have ice cream.  \n\nOnce you've got your fill of riverside sunshine, head back into civilization where JB has great Japanese at [Genji](https://www.genji.ca/) off Elgin and raves about the ramen being dished out at [Wei's Noodle House](https://www.facebook.com/WeisNoodleHouse/) on Bronson.  SM continues the Eastern theme on Somerset West at [Hung Sum](https://www.facebook.com/HungSumRestaurant) -- \"my go-to for dim sum (but go with someone who knows what they're doing!)\".  \n\nHang a left off Somerset onto Preston to jump all the way from [Chinatown](https://ottawatourism.ca/en/about-ottawa/neighbourhoods/chinatown) to [Little Italy](https://ottawatourism.ca/en/about-ottawa/neighbourhoods/little-italy) -- the legitimacy of these neighbourhood names being a topic for another time -- and head on down to [Haldi](http://www.haldi.ca/) where DA promises you'll get your tumeric fix (photo).  From their website: \"Our restaurant utilizes and promotes this key ingredient in everyday cooking simply because of its purity, diversity, and fertility abilities\" -- and if you don't believe us, check out the street view (link) -- even the building is yellow!  \n\nAs our last stop on this culinary tour, slide one block off Preston to gaze in awe at [Atelier](https://www.atelierrestaurant.ca/).  In SM's own words, this one is best saved \"for a suuuper special occiasion\" -- but with the towers of Carleton over Dow's Lake coming into view, we daresay the opportunity may just present itself...",

        "To kick off our last working week, we thought we'd take a wax-covered tablet out of the Greek playbook and share a few strategies to keep your education a little bit physical for all that frosty fieldwork ahead.\n\nStarting things close to home are the well-priced options at Carleton (link).  Included in your student fees are a whole host of [sporting facilities](https://athletics.carleton.ca/campus-rec/) -- LS was a big fan of the lane swims while AV bounced off the walls in the nearby squash courts.  Throw in a couple of winter walks around the fieldhouse and the chance to firm up your footwork during public skating and you'll find plenty of indoor options to stay sane during the long winter months.\n\nIf you don't feel like going it alone, check out Carleton's slate of [group classes](https://athletics.carleton.ca/fitness/group-classes/) -- in addition to the usual yoga, pilates, spin, and core hiits, the university offers a [skating course](https://athletics.carleton.ca/cu-fitness/skatingbeginnerintermediate/) which will make your canal cavorting all that more enjoyable.  Be sure to sign up for the grad students' [softball](https://gsacarleton.ca/softball/) league -- no prior experience is required for \"a minimum of seriousness and a maximum of fun\" (their words!).  Grad student softball was a perennial favourite for AV and his motley crew, a team mostly assembled at the Wednesday [trivia night](https://gsacarleton.ca/mikes-place/) held at the Carleton grad students' pub.\n\nWhen it comes to the most Ultimate of hobbies, JB will happily be your guide to the myriad of offerings at [Carleton Athletics](https://athletics.carleton.ca/cu-leagues/intramural-ultimate/), the dedicated folks at the [Ottawa-Carleton Ultimate Association](https://www.ocua.ca/), and the jacks-of-all-trades at the [Ottawa Sport and Social Club](https://ossc.ca/).  Trust us when we say that there is a league, level, and location to suit your style, with indoor offerings in the winter to complement the outdoor leagues in spring and fall.\n\nSpeaking of the OSSC, they run a seriously impressive number of [leagues](https://ossc.ca/sport-listing/leagues), including:\n\n- floor hockey to improve your stickwork,\n- dodgeball for your tundra agility needs,\n- all-sorts-of-sports for a new game every week, and\n- curling for a full taste of Canadiana.\n\nNot yet on offer by OSSC but a sure-fire warmup for your glacier gear is your local [axe throwing](https://batlgrounds.com/axe-throwing-ottawa/#league-info) league, an axe-cellent recommendation from JB which will hatchet up the excitement -- and if these hacked-out puns have you splitting mad (wood you cut it out already!), please know that I'll compensate with some random axe of kindness, chop-chop!\n\nThank you, thank you, I'll be here all week.",

        "Out for a lark in old Lanark",
        "On this last sweet Sunday, we thought it was high time for a tour of the Ontario countryside.  As you spend more time in the various counties of Eastern Ontario, it won't take long for you to realize that there are dozens of outposts in Ottawa's orbit, each one with its own special charm and all of them variations on a common theme.\n\nTake **Perth**, for example.  Perth is a lovely little town of around six thousand people on the Tay River, named after the much larger city/river pair in Scotland (a common theme in Ontario).  When you [visit Perth](https://www.perth.ca/en/explore-perth/Explore-Perth.aspx) -- stopping on the way for some [seriously tasty cheddar cheese](https://baldersoncheese.ca/) -- you'll be naturally drawn to the stone storefronts on Main Street and the shady reaches of [Stewart Park](https://www.beautifulperth.com/stewartpark.html) on the \"\"island\"\" in the middle of town.  Depending on the season, you can check out:\n- the [Festival of the Maples](https://festivalofthemaples.com/) in April, \n- the local [Farmers' Market](https://www.perthfarmersmarket.ca/) on summer Saturdays,\n- the famous [Kilt Run](https://www.perthkiltrun.ca/) in June,\n- [Stewart Park Festival](https://www.stewartparkfestival.com/) in July (*), and\n- the [Garlic Festival](http://www.perthgarlicfestival.com/) in August.\n\n(* In case you were wondering what happens at the Stewart Park Festival, you can check out this nifty virtual concert by [David Francey](http://video.stewartparkfestival.com/) from just a few weeks ago.)\n\nThe story is much the same a few miles down County Road 43 where you find the nine thousand folks who call **Smiths Falls** home.  Among their [many attractions](https://www.smithsfalls.ca/experience/), they've got their own stretch of water (the Rideau River this time) with inner-city islands, plenty of parks, and a smattering of stony shops -- if you don't believe us, you can take the [tour](https://www.smithsfalls.ca/media/2020/05/SmithsFallsWalkingTour-WebPrint.pdf)!  They also have [locks](https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/lhn-nhs/on/rideau/activ/accueil_info), [trains](http://rmeo.org/), and a [theatre](https://smithsfallstheatre.com/) where the trains used to be.  Just be careful not to eat too much [chocolate](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/chocolate-infused-cannabis-production-tweed-smiths-falls-1.5207114)!\n\nNot to be outdone, the village of **Merrickville** is the hands-down favourite for many of our moms (LS, AV, guilty as charged).  If you're curious to [find out why](https://www.merrickville-wolford.ca/visitors), take a stroll around the [locks](https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/docs/r/on/rideau/whl-lhm/chap2/chap2A1/chap2A1i) or check out the lovely [house and garden tour](https://www.merrickville-house-tour.ca/), after which the ladies lunch at the [Yellow Canoe](https://www.yellowcanoecafe.com/) and browse another suite of shops headlined by (we're not making this up) [mustard](https://www.mustard.ca/) -- and if you don't believe us, just check out their URL.  Last (but certainly not least!), AV has a local line on the always-changing ice cream scene -- give him enough advance notice and he'll make sure you get the scoop you're looking for.\n\nRounding out today's out-of-Ottawa offerings:\n- [Murphy's Point Provincial Park](https://www.ontarioparks.com/park/murphyspoint), a prime pick for H&S for rocks/trees/water with a little mining history thrown in;\n- the old mill town of [Almonte](https://almonte.com/), another H&S favourite for its Millfall waterworks and Mill Street charm (photo); and \n- soothing your Heimweh in [Constance Bay](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/364553897), an aptly-named stretch of the Ottawa river which LS recommends for its pleasantly surprising amount of sand -- just make sure you [play nice with the locals](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/how-many-is-too-many-and-whos-deciding-constance-bay-grapples-with-influx-of-beach-goers) (would seem that the two Konstanzes have that in common!);\n\n...and this is mostly just (link) Lanark County!  Should you decide that you rather feel like heading downriver towards Montr√©al, you can fill up on cheese curds in [St. Albert](https://fromagestalbert.com/?lang=en), then burn them all off jumping in Grenville's [old canal](http://www.capitalgems.ca/grenville-canal.html) or skate-skiing around the stunning [Ch√¢teau Montebello](https://www.fairmont.com/montebello/)... but that's a tale for another time.\n\nHappy exploring and don't forget to write!",

        "Welcome back to the weekend!\n\nThis time we're going to start things off a little differently.  It's the third Saturday of the month and IG warmly welcomes you to join the [Shepherds Crew](https://www.stjbshrine.ca/soup-kitchen/) for a morning of peeling potatoes, chopping carrots, and building and bagging a serious number of sandwiches.  These mornings hold a special meaning for LS, AV, and many others besides -- we honestly haven't found a better way to start the weekend, plus, that soup!\n\nSpending a Saturday morning at Shepherds (link) is also a great way to hear about the goings-on at the local [Ukrainain Catholic church](https://www.stjbshrine.ca/), ranging from the tranquility of weekly Vespers (Saturdays at 18) to the various choral concerts and dinner/dances held throughout the year.  Leading the charge is the [Capital Ukrainian Festival](https://www.capitalukrainianfestival.com/), a packed weekend of dance, music, art, workshops, demonstrations, and to top it all off: enough perogies to merit one ton of caramelized onions and five hundred litres of sour cream.\n\nNot to be outdone, the Greek Orthodox church just down the street hosts the summer spectacular known as [GreekFest](http://www.ottawagreekfest.com/), which runs for a long summer week in August and features fabulous food, superb seminars on crafts/cuisine/culture, traditional tunes, and the zany Zorba show to end every evening.  Rumour has it you might even find a Greek language lesson or two --  study hard, we might finally find out what they put in those magical Loukoumades!\n",

His current highlights are:\n- [Flora Hall](https://florahallbrewing.ca/) in Centretown,\n- [Overflow](https://overflowbeer.com/) on south Bank, and\n- [Beyond the Pale](https://btpshop.ca/) in Little Italy,\n\nthat last one being source of many a Pink Fuzzy memory (photo/link) for AV.\n\nOn the other side of the river, AV recommends a sunny afternoon on the aptly named *Ruisseau de la Brasserie* for a [pleasant stroll](https://www.gatineau.ca/portail/default.aspx?p=activites_evenements_idees_sorties/activites_patrimoniales/circuits_pedestres/circuit_pedestre_ruisseau_brasserie) in the summer and a [peaceful *patinage*](https://www.gatineau.ca/portail/default.aspx?p=activites_evenements_idees_sorties/patinage_glace_exterieure/patinoire_ruisseau) in the winter.

That's right: it's date night!\n\nStarting close to Carleton, JB suggests that you head into Old Ottawa South and take in a flick at the [Mayfair](https://mayfairtheatre.ca/), one of the oldest surviving independent movie houses in Canada featuring plenty of second-run, classic, and [cult films](https://apt613.ca/rocky-horror-halloween-and-monthly-midnight-debauchery-at-the-mayfair/) throughout the year.  Should you find yourself becoming a fan of independent theatre, keep your fingers crossed for the [Bytowne](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/bytowne-cinema-announces-permanent-closure-i-wish-things-could-be-different) which we all hope will find a way to turn the lights back on before too long.\n\nIf you prefer your theatre a bit more three-dimensional, SM shares her passion for all things performing by recommending a show, play, or musical at any (or all!) of Ottawa's fine theatre venues.  High on her list are [Arts Court](https://artscourt.ca/), [The Gladstone](https://www.thegladstone.ca/), the [Great Canadian Theatre Company](https://www.gctc.ca/), the [Ottawa Little Theatre](http://www.ottawalittletheatre.com/), and the [Kanata Theatre](https://kanatatheatre.ca/) -- and if you're hankering for more, the link will guide you to all the community theatre you could ever ask for.\n\nRounding out our date night offering are:\n- art and music nights at the [Orange Gallery](https://www.orangeartgallery.ca/), a personal favourite for DA;\n- indoor-outdoor lawn games at [Playback](https://www.playbackottawa.ca/) where JB will happily challenge you to shuffleboard or bocce ball (Canada's *p√©tanque*); and\n- the June extravaganza that is [Doors Open Ottawa](https://ottawa.ca/en/arts-heritage-and-events/museums-and-historic-sites/doors-open-ottawa), a red-letter date on AV's calendar and many others besides.\n\nEnjoy your evening and get your Thursday nerds home safe -- you'll all need a good sleep to get ready for real Friday, just around the corner!",

Sneak past Kettleman's to visit [La Brioche](https://la-brioche.business.site/) where AV first found his fondness for Lebanese desserts.  We would try to give you tips, but we don't know what any of the dainties are called -- luckily the prices are so good you can try them all until you find the one you like!\n\nNow that you're sufficiently sugared, jump back on the Rideau Canal Pathway and enjoy the lovely stretch of the canal leading to Dow's Lake.  At Carling Ave, switch over to the Trillium Pathway and make your way northward along the Trillium Line (O-Train Line 2) to Bayview Station and the [Ottawa River Pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Pathway#Ottawa_River_Pathway), a crucial east-west corridor for burning off all that baklava.  \n\nMake your way up the river all the way to Westboro Beach, noting all the lovely islands for later adventures.  Cross the Sir John A. Parkway and wander into Westboro, where JB (apple) fritters away his doughnut dollars at [Maverick's](http://www.mavericksdonuts.com/) and LS suggests another serving of gluten-free goodness at [Strawberry Blonde](https://www.strawberryblondebakery.com/).  \n\nFinally -- if you haven't yet succumbed to the sugar rush! -- heave your trusty two-wheeler down to Hintonburg where JB is a big fan of the fresh take on Finnish *munkki* which can be found at [SuzyQ](https://suzyq.ca/).

JB's own pick for Indian food, [Taj](https://tajindiancuisine.com/), is just a couple blocks away -- sounds like a delicious showdown is in the offing!\n\nSticking around Britannia for a bit, JB points us to the [Shawarma Palace](http://shawarmapalace.ca/) on Carling, his personal pick for Ottawa's version of D√∂ner Kebab.  Shawarma can be found *√ºberall* in Ottawa thanks to the city's large Lebanese community.  It has a different flavour profile than the one you're used to, largely owing to the sauces and toppings -- AV is a big fan of the pickled turnips and hummus while the garlic sauce is an absolute game-changer.  \n\nIf a little falafel isn't quite the taste of home you were looking for, JB is also a big fan of the [Central Bierhaus](https://www.centralbierhaus.com/) -- want to take three guesses what they have on their menu? If you said Perogies, Bao, and Poutine, you've already integrated!  All of the wurst jokes aside, a good plate of Sp√§tzle may well be worth the trek to Kanata, especially since the Bierhaus is right on the Transitway.  \n\nRounding out our (Wellington) west side story, head back into Hintonburg to \"sea food and eat it\" with SB at [Supply and Demand](https://www.supplyanddemandfoods.ca/) -- rumour has it they run the place locally, sustainably, and most of all: deliciously!

SM gets her mojo back by partaking in \n- a quick bite at [Biscotti](https://www.biscottichelsea.ca/en) (DA: \"Great coffee\"),\n- a pint at the [Chelsea Pub](https://www.chelseapub.ca/en),\n- a frozen treat at [La Cigale](https://www.lacigaleicecream.com/index.html),\n- and (!!) take-home pastries from [Une Boulangerie dans un Village](https://www.facebook.com/Une-Boulangerie-dans-un-Village-834474803287863/).\n\nShould you be looking to dust off your boots and enjoy a touch of class, Chelsea also has you covered:\n- Pop back into the Park and visit the [Mackenzie King Estate](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/mackenzie-king-estate), the summer retreat of Canada's most eccentric prime minister.

        "Rise and shine, it's border-jumping time!\n\nHope you got plenty of pineapple juice last night because we've got a full weekend ahead of us.  An easy thirty-minute bike ride from Carleton brings you to the front gates of Gatineau Park.  We're all a bit biased, but we think that Ottawa's pretty lucky to have its own bit of the Canadian Shield in its backyard and we're delighted to give you a few tips on how you can make the most of it.\n\nThe park and its many trails (link) present a four-season delight: \n- blooming white trilliums of spring on the Lauriault Trail, \n- beating the summer heat in [Lac Philippe](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/philippe-lake), \n- scrambling through autumn colours on the heights of the Camp Fortune [disc golf](https://www.odgc.ca/courses/camp-fortune/) course, \n- and snowshoeing through a crystal-clear winter's night. \n\nIf you're looking to dust off your hiking boots, DA's top trail picks are Wolf Trail on the Eardley Escarpment (providing a picturesque panorama some 270m over the Ottawa Valley) and the [Carbide Willson Ruins](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/carbide-willson-ruins), a remarkable mixture of natural and technical history with one heck of a nice hike and swimming hole thrown in for good measure.  If you're more in the mood for a bike ride, LS recommends [Sunday mornings](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/sunday-bikedays) when cars are verboten and you can enjoy the puzzling yet pristine [Pink Lake](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/pink-lake) in peace.\n\nOn those hot summer days when you're ready to jump right in, AV recommends driving the extra miles to reach [Lac La P√™che](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/la-peche-lake), complete with a postcard-perfect \"cliff dive\" from the rocks hugging the left-hand bend of the beach.  While you're in the neighbourhood, be sure to stop by the local [casse-cro√ªte](https://goo.gl/maps/uPkvHoXDdTFer4TM7) to pick up a poutine the way it was meant to be made.  When winter rolls around, take a leaf out of SM's favourite playbook and pack your bag for a ski or snowshoe into one of the park's [overnight cabins](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/blog/overnight-park-enjoy-winter).  It may take a bit of planning but it's an absolute joy every time -- and trust us, they provide plenty of firewood.\n\nLast but not least, a perennial favourite on everyone's \"you gotta see it to believe it\" is the wondrous [Lusk Cave](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/lusk-cave), reached after a lovely hike in the forest around Lac Philippe.  The cave is home to Lusk Creek which dives underground to meander through a hundred metres of marble tunnels and chambers before popping back out onto the forest floor.  The entire cave is navigable and the water is never more than a metre deep -- a bathing suit and a headlamp are all you need to enjoy a waterslide no amusement park can rival.  Visit in the spring to feel the force of the water and return in the late summer to enjoy a bathtub's temperature and traquility.\n\n...and we guess that should be enough to get you started!  If you need any more ideas, just drop by the [Visitor's Centre](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/gatineau-park-visitor-centre) where some friendly young students will do their best to warn you about recent bear sightings in both official languages.

If you're not in the mood to support the draft, keep heading up Bank to the [Fourth Avenue Wine Bar](https://107fourthavenue.com/), JF's first choice for the fruits of the vine.\n\nBopping a little further along Bank finds us on the 300 block of Somerset, a somewhat-hidden strip of pubs and restaurants highlighted by [Union Local 613](https://www.union613.ca/).  Their southern USA cuisine packs a punch AV can still recall and SM wholeheartedly recommends their solid cocktail list.  H&S remind you to case the joint -- the basement boasts a bookcase-shielded speakeasy while the second floor (with its own access) serves as the home of the sister establishment Jabberwocky, complete with vegan plates and its own delicious cocktails.\n\nContinuing our cocktail-driven romp, SM gives another couple shouts-out to Centretown's [Rabbit Hole](https://rabbitholeott.ca/) on Sparks (where when the summer sun shines, you might be lucky enough to see a busker or two!) and Lowertown's [Atari](http://www.atariottawa.com/) in the Byward Market for solid eats and drinks on a supremely sunny rooftop patio.  Should you need an even stronger shot of Vitamin D, H&S are only too happy to elevate your game to the 16th floor at [Copper Spirits and Sights](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/canada/andaz-ottawa-byward-market/yowaz/dining) in the Andaz hotel, easily the city's tallest rooftop bar.\n\nNext, catch the Confederation Line westward from the Market (or the Trillium Line north from Carleton!) and make your way to Little Italy, where the oddly-named (and even more oddly-decorated) [Pub Italia](https://pubitalia.ca/) boasts a \"BEvERage bible\" that DA happily peruses whenever the mood to sift through some 200 varieties of bottled brews strikes.  Not to be outdone, SM routinely takes her guests to [Ward 14](https://www.wardfourteen.com/) for the one-two combo of tater-tot poutine and \"the funkiest consignment bar in town\".  Rounding out SM's west-side story is [Bar Lupulus](https://barlupulus.ca/), a special-occassion celebration of all things fermented: craft beer, natural wine, and a seriously tasty charcuterie.",

After the sun goes down on the Glebe, DA kicks back at [Irene's](https://irenes-pub-restaurant.myshopify.com/) when he's in the mood for walkable local music almost any night of the week.  \n\nHeading into the Centre of Town, the [National Arts Centre](https://nac-cna.ca/en/) features many a musical majesty from its hexagonal heights -- luckily, you can fight off altitude sickness from the sometimes sky-high ticket prices through student discounts and [Live Rush](https://nac-cna.ca/en/tickets/save).

Ottawa, being Canada's capital, has a great deal of urban green space which is funded by the federal coffers through the National Capital Commission (*Commission de la capitale nationale*, link).  It's not our job to discuss whether this perk is particularly fair to the rest of Conderation -- instead, fill up your backpack with all the fresh goodies you bought at the Ottawa Farmer's Market this morning (Sunday, sweet!) and jump on your bike for a quick tour of the town!\n\nWe'll start our journey at [Hog's Back Falls](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/hogs-back-park), the first of two waterfalls that gave rise to the Ottawa portion of the Rideau Canal.  The falls are an impressive mix of water/rock/foliage and reach their pinnacle in the springtime as the waters of the swollen Rideau River race their way northward.  Have fun taking in the falls from all sorts of angles (the rocks are scramble-friendly) then check out one of the nearby parks -- Mooney's Bay features one of Ottawa's [city-run beaches](https://ottawa.ca/en/recreation-and-parks/swimming#beaches) while [Vincent Massey Park](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/vincent-massey-park) is perfect for a summertime picnic.  \n\nFollowing the canal northward from the falls will bring you to the [Arboretum](https://friendsofthefarm.ca/plan-your-visit/attractions/), a tree-lover's refuge just a frisbee throw away from Carleton.  Solitude in the summer gives way to a surprisingly fun toboggan hill in the winter -- combined with a trip to the Experimental Farm it can be just the ticket for a case of the February blues.  \n\nAfter getting your fill of the Greater Carleton Greenery, JB suggests that make your way downtown and breathe in the majesty of the Ottawa River from [Major's Hill Park](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/majors-hill-park) and the nearby [Nepean Point](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/nepean-point), two wonderful bits of tranquility in Ottawa's political and cultural heart.  Take in the views of Gatineau and the Alexandra Bridge before making your way (carefully!) down the escarpment to step all over the eight-lock staircase that completes the Rideau Canal's journey from Kingston.  Cross the canal on any (or all!) of the closed locks and find a way to climb Parliament Hill -- if you time it right, you might just get a chance to hear a [carillon concert](https://www.ourcommons.ca/About/HistoryArtsArchitecture/carillon/programme-e.htm#2020-12-10) or a little [light show](https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/campaigns/sound-light-show.html), both of which are an absolute must.\n\nFrom Parliament, you can head west along the waterline -- SM recommends Sundays when the [Macdonald Parkway](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/news/nokia-sunday-bikedays-starts-this-weekend) is closed to vehicle traffic and open for lovely little pop-up caf√©s along the way where you can pick up a coffee to enjoy on the wonderfully tranquil Bate Island in the middle of the Champlain Bridge.  Conversely, heading eastbound and downstream from Major's Hill will take you to the hidden gem of [Rockcliffe Park](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/rockcliffe-park-and-the-rockeries), perched high above the river in remarkable seclusion from surrounding city.  DA recommends daffodil season when hundreds of thousands (!!) of flowers dot the park's green lawns.\n\nAs a final tip from SB and HS (which makes use of the \"expanded\" definition of the City of Ottawa), make sure you find a Sunday to visit the [Mer Bleue Bog](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/mer-bleue) which has (we are not making this up) \"a northern ecosystem that is more typical of the Arctic than the Ottawa Valley\".

Such a statement is well worth its own Adventskalender, but today we'll stick with Theme #2 and head back to times gone by -- Colonel John By, specifically.\n\nAnother one of the old white guys of Canadian history, Colonel By was charged with the construction of a canal connecting Kingston on Lake Ontario with Montr√©al on the Ottawa-St. Lawrence system, effectively bypassing the Ontario portion of the St. Lawrence River which directly bordered the expansionist Americans in New York State.  Though the Rideau Canal never quite realized its original military purpose, it gave birth to the settlement of Bytown-come-Ottawa and served in its time as an essential inland waterway for goods and passengers alike. \n\nFast-forward 175 years and the canal has been transformed into a UNESCO world heritage site (link) and an artery for all manners of human-powered transport -- and none more beloved than a pair of freshly-sharpened skates.  At the first sign of a frozen canal, all eyes are on the [Skateway website](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/rideau-canal-skateway) as the National Capital Commission works day and night to prepare and maintain some 7.8 kilometres of icy bliss.  Once the season has opened, countless possibilities await:\n\n- commuting to Carleton and enjoying a lunchtime lap around Dow's lake;\n- booking it to the Bank Street Bridge for after-school errands;\n- watching sun set on Parliament from the shelter by Laurier Bridge; and\n- skating home under starry skies after a long night on Elgin Street.\n\nAnd as the icing on top, the frozen canal is the backbone of the equally legendary [Winterlude](https://ottawatourism.ca/en/see-and-do/winterlude), a February fortnight festival which is a winter highlight for DA (and many others besides!).  Grab yourself a [BeaverTail](https://beavertails.com/) from one of their on-ice kiosks and let the ice sculptures in Confederation Park take your breath away.  \n\nDespite what the locals tell you, winter does eventually come to an end and with the first buds of spring comes a whole new slate of waterway delights.  The [Dow's Lake Pavilion](https://www.dowslake.com/) offers a rental fleet of pedal boats, paddle boards, canoes, and kayaks -- though if you ask nicely, IG can show you the way to a two-seater hidden by the Flora Footbridge at a price that just can't be beat. Once you get on the water, be sure to explore the unique character of the canal's many bends, with AV giving a special shout-out to the hidden tranquility of [Patterson Creek](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/patterson-creek-park).\n\nLast but certainly not least, you can also enjoy the canal from dry land!  Both banks have a well-maintained multi-purpose path which welcomes walkers, runners, cyclists, roller-skaters, and even the occasional cross-country skier desparately staying in shape for another year on the trails.  There are plenty of chances to cross the canal, none more adventurous than crossing across the gates of any closed lock -- you'll learn the unwritten rules of foot (and bike!) traffic before too long, especially since [Hartwells Locks](https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/docs/r/on/rideau/whl-lhm/chap2/chap2A1/chap2A1b) by Carleton are your gateway to the delights of the Arboretum and Experimental Farm.  \n\nWhether serving as a human-powered superhighway or a chance to hang out with a few of our feathered friends, the Rideau Canal is a gem to be enjoyed in every season -- just try not to go for a swim!",

        "Pub Tour #1: Elgin Street",
        "Good thing you saved all that money going to free museums on Student Friday, 'cause actual Friday might get a little pricey...\n\nWop bop a loo bop, the weekend's here!  Before you set out for your first taste of Ottawa nightlife, we thought we'd give you a chance to continue the [best way to start the weekend](https://www.visitnorway.com/media/news-from-norway/in-oslo-every-day-is-taco-friday/) by popping over to Vanier for LS's taco favourite at [Ola Cocina](http://www.olacocina.ca/) -- if the weather's nice, you can even grab your grub to go and enjoy the often-overlooked linear parks along the Rideau River right up to the waterfall that gives the river its name.\n\nOnce you've had your fill of fresh air and fajitas, come on back to Centretown and immerse yourself in the legacy of James Bruce (photo/link), the 8th Earl of Elgin who served as a surprisingly competent and transformational colonial governor.  Among other admirable old white guy achievements, he allowed the colony to achieve responsible government for the first time -- and in gratitude, the city of Ottawa named their longest stretch of pubs in his honour.\n\nLong-time Elgin Street local LS has plenty of suggestions: \n- the basement vibe at the [Manx Pub](https://www.manxpub.com/) (AV vaguely remembers good eats!),\n- the labyrinthine [Lieutenant's Pump](https://www.lieutenantspump.ca/) where every seat is a corner booth,\n- the [Fox and Feather](https://www.foxandfeather.ca/) anytime from brunch until (way past) bedtime,\n- [Pancho Villa](https://www.panchovilla.ca/) for their margaritas, \n- and a new wine bar called [Gitanes](https://www.gitanes.co/) for fancier evenings.\n\nIf cocktails are the order of the evening, SM doubles down on Elgin with two picks of her own: [Charlotte](https://www.charlotteottawa.com/) and [Datsun](https://datsun.mobi2go.com/), with the latter serving up some mean Asian fusion cuisine.\n\nAnd of course, no discussion of Elgin Street could be complete without mention of \"\"the hockey\"\" -- under the erstwhile moniker Sens Mile the street serves as something of a Public Viewing hotspot whenever the local hockey team is scoring a statistically significant number of goals.  AV caught his last game at [MacLaren's](https://maclarens.com/), but if Lord Stanley is coming anywhere close to Lord Elgin you'll have just as much fun out on the street.  \n\nNo matter where you go, be sure to enjoy responsibly -- the way James Bruce would have wanted!",

        "As I guess you've gathered from Carleton's silly slogan, Ottawa serves as the capital of the Dominion of Canada, a decision made by Queen Victoria herself after a fascinating bidding process by various cities in the former colonies... but I digress.\n\nOttawa may not quite be the sort of national capital that you're familiar with, but as the talented [Paul Wells](https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/world-class-whine-why-ottawas-haters-are-wrong/) once noted, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Ottawa enjoys a great many perks as Canada's capital, not the least of which is a staggering array of national museums -- all of which you can visit for free!\n\nTo kick things off, let's talk about Thursday, one of the best days of the week.  In addition to being Student Friday, it's also the day you can get free evening admission (17-20) at the big three:\n- Go say hi to Maman and take in some of Kurulek's finest at the [National Gallery](https://www.gallery.ca/) -- IG kindly reminds you to stay off the sculptures, no matter how climbable they may seem!\n- Dive into the surprisingly thoughtful galleries at the [War Museum](https://www.warmuseum.ca/) for an across-the-Atlantic perspective on history you know well, bookended by poignant perspectives on the past and present.\n- Jump across the border to Gatineau and visit the highly civilized [Canadian Museum of History](https://www.historymuseum.ca/), an all-time SB favourite with highlights too many to mention.  AV recommends borrowing a child for the Canadian Children's Museum, while you can ask IG for a special invitation to the yearly service for Heilige Drei K√∂nige (a.k.a. Theophany) held at a chapel within museum's walls.\n\nIf you get that museum itch and you just can't wait until Thursday, the trio of tech museums known as Ingenium offer free admission for the last hour every day:\n- Go for a bike ride along the Ottawa river through Rockcliffe Park and let your dreams take flight at the [Aviation and Space Museum](https://ingeniumcanada.org/aviation), featuring a great deal of flight hardware complemented by a small yet worthwhile exhibition on human spaceflight and remote sensing.\n- Sneak out of the lab at Carleton and cross the Rideau Canal to reach the [Agriculture and Food Museum](https://ingeniumcanada.org/agriculture) -- an exceptional escape any time of the year with a hands-down highlight in the spring when the barns overflow with new life.  \n_(read: baby animals, for free, every day of the week, right when you need that PhD pickup the most)_\n- The dark horse of the group is the [Science and Technology Museum](https://ingeniumcanada.org/scitech), a personal favourite from AV's childhood that has been completely rebuilt following a leaky roof episode.  Rumour has it they kept the trains and the kitchen -- if so, it's an hour worth spending.\n\nRounding out the roster of national museums is the [Nature Museum](https://nature.ca/en/home), which just to be different is free Wed-Fri for the last hour-and-a-quarter.  It's absolute gem in a stunning building right off the Ridau Canal and features plenty of Canadian flora and fauna, including an Arctic Gallery!  DA can recommend an outstanding tour guide by day, while SM and JB have magical memories from many a Nature Nocturne when the lights go down and the volume turns up on a fabulous night at the museum (link/photo).\n\nLast (but certainly not least!) are the always-free tours of the [Canadian Parliament](https://visit.parl.ca/sites/Visit/default/en_CA) and [Rideau Hall](https://www.gg.ca/en/visit-us/rideau-hall/plan-your-visit), though given the ongoing renovations which will most definitely last longer than any possible PhD... maybe you'd better stick with the scientists!",

It's the hippest feeling one!\"  \n\nIf you find yourself hanging out in Centretown, grab a nice coffee at [Grounded Kitchen and Coffeebar](https://groundedkitchencoffee.com/) (SM recommends their breaklubrunch!) or head on over to the [Ministry of Coffee](https://theministryofcoffee.com/) where, sometime in the last decade, AV first encountered the tantalizingly mysterious cortado.  \n\nFinally if it's too much trouble to keep track of all these tips, you can always count on [Bridgehead](https://www.bridgehead.ca/) -- they have a staggering nineteen locations in town, led by JB's personal favourite, their flagship roastery on Preston.  \n\nNow that you're properly fed and caffeinated, grab a waterbottle and get ready -- we've got a national capital to explore!",
